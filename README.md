This project is my portfolio, a project in Django that contains my other projects such as **Movie Finder**, **Sentimento** *(Sentiment Analysis App)*, or **To-Do** App. There are also a variety of projects in which I learned the fun sides and possibilities of JavaScript and links to the GitHub pages with descriptions of my projects not related to web development.

## ðŸ—ƒ &nbsp;Portfolio
The home page of my site contains my projects in which I studied the features of JavaScript and its libraries such as `p5.js`, `three.js`, `gsap.js` and others, there are also a couple of projects on pure CSS, including a project using `css-doodle`. When the time comes, I will write a full description of each project.
